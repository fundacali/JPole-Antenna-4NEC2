JPole Antenna Project with 4NEC2
This repository contains the 4NEC2 (.nec) file for a J-Pole Antenna designed for the 146 MHz VHF band.The project demonstrates proficiency in Computational Electromagnetics (CEM) and simulation tool usage, focusing on antenna design and matching network principles.Key Technical Details:Design Goal: To create a vertically polarized, omnidirectional antenna with low-angle radiation.Operating Frequency: 146 MHz.Matching Principle: The antenna uses the characteristic J-stub geometry to transform the radiator's natural impedance to 50 Ohms. The feed point is precisely located at $0.3593$ m along the matching stub.Geometric Parameters: The model uses defined symbolic variables for element radii (big=$0.0365$ m, small=$0.026$ m) to ensure dimensional accuracy and easy optimization.
